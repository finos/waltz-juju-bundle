# Charmed Waltz
A Charmed bundle containing everything needed to deploy and operate Waltz on a Kubernetes cluster: 

* [**finos-waltz-k8s**](https://github.com/finos/waltz-integration-juju), which contains the Waltz server.
* [**postgresql-k8s**](https://charmhub.io/postgresql-k8s), responsible for creating a PostgreSQL database on demand for the related ``finos-waltz-k8s`` charm.
* [**nginx-ingress-integrator**](https://charmhub.io/nginx-ingress-integrator), which manages the ingress traffic for the related ``finos-waltz-k8s`` charm, allowing users to connect to Waltz through a friendly, configurable ``service-hostname`` instead of an ephemeral IP.

>üí°If you are evaluating Waltz, you can follow [this guide](/docs/guides/LocalDeployment.md) for a quick 10-minutes Waltz deployment. You will also learn how to provision a K8s cluster on your laptop using MicroK8s. You don't need to have any previous Kubernetes knowledge!

## Waltz 
From the projects [repository](https://github.com/finos/waltz):
> In a nutshell Waltz allows you to visualize and define your organisation's technology landscape. Think of it like a structured Wiki for your architecture.

## Juju and Charmed Operators

The [Juju Charmed Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://juju.is/docs/olm) is a hybrid-cloud application management and orchestration system for installation and day 2 operations. It helps deploy, configure, scale, integrate, maintain, and manage Kubernetes native, container-native and VM-native applications‚Äîand the relations between them.

A charmed operator (also known, more simply, as a ‚Äúcharm‚Äù) encapsulates a single application and all the code and know-how it takes to operate it, such as how to combine and work with other related applications or how to upgrade it. Charms are programmed to understand a single application, its operations, and its potential to communicate or integrate with other applications. A charm defines and enables the channels by which applications connect.

### Cloud vendor agnostic

The instructions cover the deployment of FINOS Waltz charmed operators on a host PC. However these charms can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster.

### Multi-hybrid cloud

The applications necessary to run Waltz were deployed as a _bundle_ in the same cloud. [Juju](https://juju.is/) allows, however, for you to deploy each application on a different cloud and then integrate the stack across your estate.

### Offline installation

We assume your host had a functioning Internet connection. However it is also possible to [deploy charmed operators offline](https://juju.is/docs/olm/working-offline).

## Installation
To get started, you can checkout the [local run documention](/docs/guides/LocalDeployment.md), which will walk you through and explain all the different deployment steps to run a local Waltz instance, and will point you to docs for alternative deployments, such as clouds, barebone installations and other.

## FINOS Waltz Resource Updates

This repository is set up to be able to release a new ``finos-waltz-k8s`` charm revision with the latest Waltz docker image. For more information, see [here](docs/development/CharmPublishing.md).
